# LapRFTimingAndroidPublic
Open source LapRF Timing app for Android

This source code is the complete implementation of the free android app which supports the ImmersionRC LapRF hardware. 

# Disclaimer
ImmersionRC specializes primarily in RF, Hardware, and Firmware for the FPV (drone) market. This app was created to support the LapRF hardware. ImmersionRC does not specialize in app development for mobile devices and to be honest this code base is not something we are proud of. 

It is being released into the public domain to hopefully encourage LapRF customers who like to dabble in android development to improve the application, especially in the areas of support for newer android devices, and integrating timing data into other systems. 

# License
ImmersionRC reserves the right to use any changes submitted to this github repository to periodically update the public build of the app.

For licenses to use the code commercially, please contact us at support@immersionrc.com 

# Building 
The only tool required to build this app is the publicly available Android Studio. 

# Debugging
The use of Bluetooth requires (for some unknown reason) permissions to access the device's location. Be sure to accept location access when running the app on your device. 
(If any developer knows how to remove this requirement please let us know...)
